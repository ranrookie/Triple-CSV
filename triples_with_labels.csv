2005.5.232,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges.  This Ming-era rank badge features a pair of golden pheasants, representing a second-rank civil official. Surrounding the birds in this badge are peonies and clouds. The lower bird is perched on a scholar's rock, which are particularly-shaped rocks appreciated by the literati and found in Chinese gardens. This badge is woven in tapestry, with a ground made from gold-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss.",Description

The tree they lean on is adorned with sparse leaves, indicating the transition of seasons, possibly autumn. Its branches stretch across the composition, framing the scene and adding a sense of depth.

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a bear embroidered in gold metal-wrapped and multicoloured silk floss, which represents a fifth rank military official. Bears and lions are often confused on rank badges, as the bear has a mane and tail that appears similar to a lion's. However, a bear's tail curls only at the base, whereas a lion's tail curls at the base and tip. A lion also has a curly mane, while a bear's mane hangs in straight tendrils.  The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The sun on the right side of these badges indicates that the wearer was female, likely the spouse of a military official. The bear, positioned at the center of the badge, is surrounded by flames, clouds, rocks, and standing water waves. A flaming wheel, a Buddhist symbol, can be seen amongst the waves with other obscured treasures. There are bats throughout the sky, which are a symbol of good luck. Many flowers are embroidered in the background, including peonies. Gold metal-wrapped threads outline auspicious symbols and also make up the geometric border design.",Description

This leaf contains an ink and watercolour drawing of four porters carrying an official litter containing a high ranking passenger. The porters all wear mid-length black tunics over blue and black pants. They also wear brown coned hats with red tassels. The litter is enclosed, but with outlines of opening windows and a flower vase inside. The front of the litter is open to reveal that the passenger, likely an official, is wearing a long blue robe and black boots.",Description

In the background, the heads of the tree exceed the parapet wall, which has a motif of jumbled semicircles framed by rectangles. Atop a standing shelf sits an incense burner, with smoke rising into the air. The foliage behind the structure shows the season, possibly late autumn, due to the brownish hues. The inscription on the right writes “Ren Yi, also known as Ren Bonian from Shanyin [山陰仁颐伯年[???],” and the red seal belongs to him.",Description

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a tiger embroidered in metal-wrapped threads, which represents a fourth rank military official. The tiger is identified by its black stripes and a wan symbol on its forehead, indicating the tiger is a king.  The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The embroidery on this badge is rendered entirely in metal-wrapped threads of varying hues, all expertly couched in place with silk floss. The border contains bats and shou characters, which all act as lucky symbols for the wearer. The tiger is positioned in the middle of the badge, above rocks and standing water waves and surrounded by a sky filled with clouds and lotus flowers. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official. The tiger is appliquéd onto the badge background so that it may be easily replaced with other beasts as the military official moves up through the ranks.",Description

Each leaf contains a landscape, which was painted in situ by Wang Gai. Repeating themes throughout the album include figures immersed in the natural environment, which reflects the literati’s yearning and nostalgia. This scene depicts a man sitting against the trunk of a leafless pine tree in contemplation of nature. All the elements in the painting are concentrated centrally and surrounded by a mountain valley, which is suggested with unpainted negative space.",Description

2004.19.38.5,描述,"The painting is associated with the poem (2004.19.38.4). It depicts a man seated on a rock, with most of his back turned to the viewer. His body is slightly inclined forward as he turns his head toward the audience. The jagged rock on the right is rendered with bold, expressive brushstrokes, providing a striking contrast to the delicate foliage. The palm trees behind the rock are painted with subtle, layered brushwork, creating a sense of movement and depth. The inscription on the left states, “Written by Ren Yi, also known as Ren Bonian from Shanyin, in Chunshenpu (now the Huangpu River in Shanghai) [山陰任頤伯年寫于春申浦]”, and the red seal belongs to Ren Yi.",Description

2004.19.38.13,描述,"The painting is associated with the poem (2004.19.38.12). It presents a serene scene featuring two figures—a man and a young attendant —sitting on a rock beside a bamboo grove. The man is reading a book held in his hands. His hair is styled in a topknot, giving him a scholarly appearance. The attendant, positioned behind him and slightly to the side, rests his head on his folded arms. The bamboo grove occupies the left side of the composition, with tall and straight stalks. The background remains minimal, with subtle ink washes creating the impression of a misty, tranquil atmosphere. The inscription on the left reads, “Ren Yi, also known as Ren Bonian from Shanyin [山陰仁頤伯年],” and the red seal belongs to Ren Yi.",Description

The man, dressed in traditional robes, has his hands clasped behind his back and leans slightly forward. The young attendant appears to be holding a musical instrument wrapped in a yellow cover. To the left of the figures, a slender tree with thin branches extends upward, its leaves painted in warm orange hues, possibly reflecting the colors cast by the sunset. The background is dominated by the calm river, depicted in faint ink strokes.  The composition is balanced with foliage in the foreground, depicted in detailed brushwork, contrasting the simplicity of the river and sky. The color palette is muted, with earth tones and soft grays dominating the figures’ robes, while the touch of red in the leaves adds a hint of vibrancy.  On the left, Ren Yi wrote the “Seal of Bonian [伯年 印]” along with his red personal seal.",Description

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  This rank badge features a quail, representing an eighth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. This bird is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. This badge is woven in tapestry, with gold metal-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss. Coloured ink was used for colour gradation.",Description

2005.5.548.2,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a silver pheasant representing the fifth rank of a civil official. This bird is identified by its white feathers, white crown with a red stripe and long tail. The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with delicate seed stitches, also referred to as “Peking knots” or ta tzu. Gold metal-wrapped thread is couched around some of the colourful motifs as a border. In the centre of the badge, a silver pheasant, standing on rocks above waves, looks toward a red sun in the upper left corner. An embellished canopy floats above the bird, while the Eight Buddhist treasures surround it, including lotuses, the wheel, the parasol, the vase, the conch, the fish and the endless knot. The border of the badge is decorated with blue and white floral motifs and gold geometric patterns.",Description

In the centre of the badge is a silver pheasant standing on rocks above the waves and water, looking toward a red sun in the upper right corner. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the badge was used by the spouse of a civil official and decorated with her husband’s rank.",Description

In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. Early Qing badges used gold-wrapped thread embroidered in dense rows, carefully outlining each motif until the background was completely filled. The bird is perched on a scholar's rock, which is a particularly-shaped rock appreciated by the literati and found in Chinese gardens. The rock is stitched with peacock-feather twisted thread.",Description

However, in 1916, Yuan Shikai attempted to restore the Qing Empire by declaring himself Emperor Hongxian. This pair of embroidered roundels, featuring the Twelve Symbols of Imperial Authority, serves as an example of his effort to invoke imperial imagery. There are nine motifs of the Twelve Symbols embroidered on the roundel, including a pair of cups, seaweed, fire, grain, an axe, a pheasant, a dragon, mountains and the fu character in the centre.

The silk multicoloured tapestry has motifs of dragons, clouds, waves and rocks. The green silk brocade with metal-wrapped threads is patterned with floral and xi characters, which mean happiness. The inner section is pieced together from fragments of Chinese tapestry. That shows two dragons face to face, yet one of the dragons has been cut off on the right side. The dragons, which have four claws on each foot,  are both standing on one leg. Their  heads face upward with open mouths that show off their pointy white teeth. The ends of their tails resemble fishtails sweeping the tops of the waves and mountains below. The images of the dragons’ postures, sharp teeth, fierce claws, and muscular tails reveal a design style of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644).",Description

This leaf contains an ink and watercolour depiction of a man being beheaded by an executioner. The prisoner, kneeling barefoot on the left, is wearing a brown short tunic over pants with his hands behind his back. Next to him is a long narrow sign with writing, likely naming his crimes. The executioner, holding a long sword, is wearing a black jacket over black pants with a brown conical hat.",Description

2005.5.545.2,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges.  This rank badge features a golden pheasant, representing a second-rank civil official. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. Surrounding the birds in this badge are clouds and waves. This badge is made with gold and silver metal-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss.",Description

Each leaf contains a landscape, which was painted in situ by Wang Gai. Repeating themes throughout the album include figures immersed in the natural environment, which reflects the literati’s yearning and nostalgia. In this scene there are several mountain peaks around a body of water, which is painted with a dark ink wash rather than negative space, as done in other leaves in this album. There are two faintly-painted figures hiking on the mountain trail in the bottom left corner. Partially-hidden cottages are included along the shoreline and there is dense foliage dotted amongst the rocks and landscape.",Description

Nine dragons appear in typical fashion - three on the front, three on the back, two on either shoulder, and one hidden under the outer flap. The narrow sleeve shape follows a typical Manchu imperial court robe with dark blue sleeve inserts and a horse hoof-shaped cuff. Embroidered collar facings and sleeve cuffs feature five-clawed dragons couched in gold metal-wrapped thread, clouds, bats, and auspicious wan symbols. Narrow, gold metal-wrapped thread brocade trim in a geometric pattern edges these borders. Auspicious symbols can be seen throughout the robe, including the Buddhist eight treasures of lotus, parasol, wheel of the law, victory banner, conch, fish, endless knot, and vase. The hem of this robe has a typical rocks, waves, and standing water pattern. The wan symbol can be found throughout the robe background, which represents ""eternity"" or ""infinity"".",Description

Narcissus blossoms and birds, a common theme in Zhao’s other works, are both symbols of the start of spring. Zhao also utilizes the ancient Chinese painting colour palette of green and blue to set the atmosphere of this painting. By using incredibly delicate brushstrokes to outline the visual objects, she highlights the landscape’s subtleties, such as the feather of the birds, the moss of the rocks, and the stems, leaves, and petals of narcissus.",Description

This leaf contains an ink and watercolour depiction of ankle crusher torture, or jiagun, which utilized three wooden boards and a length of cord that was gradually pulled to increase the pressure on the prisoner's ankle bones. This was a non-lethal form of punishment that was used to elicit a confession from the prisoner. In this scene, a man, dressed in a blue tunic and short pants, lays prone on a wooden plank with his ankles between three long skinny boards. Four men in mid-length black jackets, blue pants, and hats with feathers surround the prisoner. One holds his shoulders down, two pull on a long cord, and the fourth uses a mallet to strike the boars, breaking the prisoner’s bones and causing immense pain.",Description

2005.5.592.2,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a leopard rendered in tapestry weave with details painted with ink, representing a third rank military official. The leopard is identified by its spots, which look like geometric marks throughout its body, and green eyebrows, which are typical in the late Qing dynasty. The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The leopard is positioned in the center of the badge, surrounded by clouds, small white flowers, bats, and other auspicious symbols. Select details are highlighted with metal-wrapped threads, including the standing water waves below the leopard. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official. The border features show characters and bats, which are symbols of luck.",Description

This surcoat has a typical front opening with five brass buttons, and three vents - two at the sides and one in the back. Garments like this were used to represent the wearer's identity to the broader society and, as such, it would have been worn as an outer garment over robes, as seen in the Family Portrait painting (2007.23.1).

Each of the embroidered roundels contains a swirling pattern of peonies and butterflies, and brightly coloured with synthetic aniline dyes, which were introduced to China from Europe at the end of the nineteenth century. Peonies, the “king of flowers” in Chinese culture, were a popular motif in the Qing Dynasty and could be found on garments, furnishings, paintings, and other material culture. The two butterflies at the center of each roundel may represent a harmonious couple, referred to as the “butterfly lovers” in an ancient Chinese romantic legend The wide sleeves on this robe have horse-hoof shaped cuffs that mimic those found on dragon robes during the Manchu reign of the Qing Dynasty. The rocks, waves, and standing water motifs found above the hem of this robe also reference the earlier robes of the imperial court. Auspicious symbols, including those from Buddhism, can be found amongst the rocks, including dragons, wan characters, canopies, the flaming wheel of the law, lotus flowers, and the endless knot. This robe was likely worn by a woman on her wedding day, based on the symbols for longevity and lucky red colour of the ground fabric, which symbolizes fertility and love.",Description

2005.5.269,描述,"This robe is a traditional style of Tibetan robe, or a chuba, made from embroidered yellow silk satin fabric, which was initially made for a dragon robe and imported to Tibet from the Qing imperial court. In Tibet, tailors modified the collar and sleeves to  suit the local style better. Thus the robe has yellow satin parts, without embroidery patterns, around the neckline and sleeve ends. The robe features motifs of dragons with flaming pearls, long thin clouds, rocks, waves and colourful striped water at the hem. There are eight dragons on the exterior of the robe: one on the chest, one on the back, one on each shoulder, and two on the front and back of the lower robe. As is typically seen in Chinese dragon robes, there is a hidden ninth dragon underneath the right overlap. There are the Twelve Symbols embroidered on the robe: the sun with a three-legged bird and the moon with a rabbit are placed on shoulders, stars and mountains are above the dragon’s head on the front and back, dragons, a pheasant, an axe, the fu symbol, cups, seaweed, flames, and grain. The placement of these symbols align with the Qing imperial costume regulations for the emperor’s dragon robe.",Description

A strategic perspective, which oversees all of the action from above, allows the viewer to see the swirling government armies in their pursuit of the rebellious Nian. There are small groups of buildings throughout the top third of the painting. Cavalry and infantry are in active combat, with many casualties seen spread around the battlefield. Notable figures have small name plates positioned above their heads to identify them to the viewer. This painting is part of a larger series of approximately 70 paintings commissioned by the Guangxu Emperor in 1885, approved by Empress Dowager Cixi in 1886, and completed in 1890. These paintings - split into four groups - commemorate the Taiping War, the Nian Rebellion, the Muslim Rebellion in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, and the Muslim Rebellion on the southwest and northwest borders. The military prowess of the Qing government is highlighted and glorified in each of these paintings. Two of these paintings are accessioned in the Mactaggart Art Collection, please see Battle Scene from the Nian Rebellion (2004.19.49).",Description

2005.5.621.5.1,描述,"A court necklace (chaozhu) with 108 translucent red glass beads (possibly imitating amber), large jadeite beads, opaque coral beads, and jadeite and brass pendants. Two strands of beads hang off the right side of the necklace, while the single strand hangs off the left. Each of these strands contains two groups of five coral beads on a silk cord and end in a jadeite teardrop pendant with a brass connector. A flat yellow silk cord with blue and white striped sections and a jadeite and brass pendant hangs down the back of the wearer's neck as a counterweight. This counterweight strand is connected to the rest of the necklace by a jadeite bead. Near this bead, the necklace cord is wrapped with white, blue and black silk thread and has two circular brass connectors. Court necklaces have 108 beads divided into four sets of 27 beads, which are separated by large Buddha beads (futou) (Vollmer, Dressed to Rule, p. 52). The Huangchao liqi tushi (2004.19.1.1.9) demonstrates how high ranking female members of the imperial court wore three court necklaces (two criss-crossed around her torso and one around her neck), with specific materials for each rank. This necklace was accessioned as a part of a group of garments and accessories that make up a man's court outfit during the Qing Dynasty. There is an accompanying blue cotton box (2005.5.621.5.2) that may have stored this necklace.",Description

2005.5.247,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. This pair of Ming-era rank badges features a pair of peacocks, representing a third-rank civil official. Surrounding the birds in this badge are peonies and clouds. These badges were woven in tapestry, with a ground made from gold-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss.",Description

This sleeve band mirrors the scene of its partner, which depicts five children - all boys - playing in a garden amongst peonies, peaches, trees, and rocks. The children are dressed in garments that were popular for youth in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). A boy near the top of the band holds a conch shell, which is an auspicious Buddhist symbol. Although this band is woven in kesi, details have been added with painted ink, including colour gradients in the flowers and children's clothing. Sleeve bands are the wide decorated cuffs attached to women's robes and jackets, often made and sold separately from the rest of the garment. They became important commercial objects in the Qing Dynasty as they are modular accessories that could be purchased in a market and attached to the garment at home.",Description

2005.5.555.1,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  This rank badge features an egret, representing a sixth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird was seen on rank badges. The egret in this badge is surrounded by ruyi-shaped clouds, with its wings outstretched and its gaze fixed on the sun disk in the upper left corner. This badge is woven in tapestry, with a ground made from metallic thread. Coloured ink was used to depict details in the bird’s body.",Description

The artist's daytime occupation as a civil servant during the Qing Dynasty permitted him free time in which to explore new ways of painting with his whole hand - palm, finger tips, and nails - rather than a traditional paintbrush. With this highly unique technique, Gao produced many similar landscape paintings throughout his life. After the painting is calligraphy by Gao Qipei, dated 1712, that contains sixteen copies of famous calligraphies (zitie) done between the Jin and Song dynasties, followed by an epilogue and a poem.",Description

2004.19.2.9,描述,"This album leaf is a part of a 48-page album that depicts Chinese subjects participating in various aspects of daily life, including government business, daily life, cultural customs, modes of transportation, and corporal punishment. This leaf depicts an ink and watercolour drawing of a husband and wife in mourning dress “after the loss of [a] father”. During the Qing dynasty, mourning costume, or sangfu, was white or light coloured and was meant to be worn for a specified period of time, depending on the relationship of the mourner to the decedent and the decedent’s social status. The female figure, on the left, wears a white cloth covering her head, as well as a long white jacket over a light brown pleated skirt (likely made from hemp). She also appears to have bound feet, and may be of Han descent. The male figure, on the right, wears a light brown hat and robe (also likely made from hemp) over white leggings. They both are holding staffs, which signify the physical weakness that one feels during the emotional pain of grieving.",Description

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  This rank badge features a xiezhi, a mythical creature with a goat- or ox-like body and a single horn on its head. It is gazing at the sun disk in the upper left corner. Renowned for distinguishing right from wrong, the xiezhi attacks the wicked, serving as a powerful symbol of justice. In the imperial court, it represented the role of the imperial censor, tasked with overseeing the ethical behaviour of officials.",Description

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a silver pheasant representing the fifth rank of a civil official. This bird is identified by its white feathers, white crown with a red stripe and long tail. The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with smooth satin stitches surrounded by couched metal-wrapped threads. Bats (which represent fortune) and auspicious motifs are scattered among coin-shaped clouds. The background is filled with green geometric lines and  wan symbols (similar in form, but not ideology, to a swastika), which symbolize infinity. In the centre of the badge is a silver pheasant standing on rocks above the waves and water, looking toward a red sun in the upper right corner. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the badge was used by the spouse of a civil official and decorated with her husband’s rank.",Description

2005.5.559.1,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a tiger embroidered in metal-wrapped threads, which represents a fourth rank military official. The tiger is identified by its black stripes and a wan symbol on its forehead, indicating the tiger is a king.  The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The embroidery on this badge is rendered entirely in metal-wrapped threads of varying hues, all expertly couched in place with silk floss. The border contains bats and shou characters, which all act as lucky symbols for the wearer. The tiger is positioned in the middle of the badge, above rocks and standing water waves and surrounded by a sky filled with clouds and lotus flowers. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official. The tiger is appliquéd onto the badge background so that it may be easily replaced with other beasts as the military official moves up through the ranks.",Description

2005.5.591.1,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  This rank badge features a bear,   representing a fifth rank military official. The bear insignia is distinguishable from the higher-ranking lion by the absence of a mane along its back, though the two designs share a similarity in overall appearance. This particular badge  is crafted entirely with knot stitches and couched cord. The border is adorned with stylized running dragons, bats, and shou characters (symbolizing longevity)",Description

2005.5.621.5,描述,"A court necklace (chaozhu) with 108 translucent red glass beads (possibly imitating amber), large jadeite beads, opaque coral beads, and jadeite and brass pendants. Two strands of beads hang off the right side of the necklace, while the single strand hangs off the left. Each of these strands contains two groups of five coral beads on a silk cord and end in a jadeite teardrop pendant with a brass connector. A flat yellow silk cord with blue and white striped sections and a jadeite and brass pendant hangs down the back of the wearer's neck as a counterweight. This counterweight strand is connected to the rest of the necklace by a jadeite bead. Near this bead, the necklace cord is wrapped with white, blue and black silk thread and has two circular brass connectors. Court necklaces have 108 beads divided into four sets of 27 beads, which are separated by large Buddha beads (futou) (Vollmer, Dressed to Rule, p. 52). The Huangchao liqi tushi (2004.19.1.1.9) demonstrates how high ranking female members of the imperial court wore three court necklaces (two criss-crossed around her torso and one around her neck), with specific materials for each rank. This necklace was accessioned as a part of a group of garments and accessories that make up a man's court outfit during the Qing Dynasty. There is an accompanying blue cotton box (2005.5.621.5.2) that may have stored this necklace.",Description

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  This pair of rank badges features a xiezhi, a mythical creature with a goat- or ox-like body and a single horn on its head. It is gazing at the sun disk in the upper left corner. Renowned for distinguishing right from wrong, the xiezhi attacks the wicked, serving as a powerful symbol of justice. In the imperial court, it represented the role of the imperial censor, tasked with overseeing the ethical behaviour of officials.",Description

The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a silver pheasant representing the fifth rank of a civil official. This bird is identified by its white feathers, white crown with a red stripe and long tail. The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with delicate seed stitches, also referred to as “Peking knots” or ta tzu. Gold metal-wrapped thread is couched around some of the colourful motifs as a border. In the centre of the badge, a silver pheasant, standing on rocks above waves, looks toward a red sun in the upper left corner. An embellished canopy floats above the bird, while the Eight Buddhist treasures surround it, including lotuses, the wheel, the parasol, the vase, the conch, the fish and the endless knot.

2005.5.305,描述,"A dark blue silk surcoat (or bufu) with tapestry woven rank badges on the front and back. There is a crane, recognizable with a red cap on its head, depicted on the square rank badges, identifying the wearer as a first-rank civil official. The position of the sun on the left side of the badge (the wearer's right side) indicates that the wearer is a man. Auspicious symbols, including bats for good fortune and a geometric wan - multiplying good fortune by an infinite amount - in the background, surround the crane and there is a standing water and waves motif below. This surcoat has a typical front opening with five brass buttons, two side vents, and a standing collar. The standing collar is not a typical design feature on surcoats, which can be seen when compared to other examples in the collection, such as Blue Silk Gauze Surcoat for a Man (2005.5.93). This robe design has likely been modified from a traditional surcoat, including longer and narrower sleeves, and may not be typical official’s attire. The lining fabric is a pale blue plain weave silk.",Description

The painters…												  													The army stationed in the West successfully achieved its task in 1759. It is only a little more than seven years from the end of the battles, in 1766, that the drawings of the conquests were finished. The painters needed this space of time in order to meticulously inquire into [what] the forms of the camps and battles [looked like] so as to compose their designs. Of the officers and soldiers who left for the campaigns and risked their lives at extreme odds, one out of a hundred survived. Giving their lives to the state ensured that their campaigns were successful, so how could I suggest that they die without recognition? That is why in the Throne Hall of the Purple Effulgent Pole Star (Ziguangge 紫光閣) we have had the portraits painted of those who distinguished themselves. And because of this motivation, we went to the bloody battlefields, we faithfully depicted the circumstances where attacks were made on our strongholds--where we broke the ardour of the enemy, beheaded the generals, and stole the flags--in order to pay homage to their efforts and to celebrate their courage. When I reviewed the military reports I dedicated some poems to them, and I rewrote them to be placed between the folios. For the six scenes that I have not yet touched with my brush [meaning he had yet inscribed them with poetry], I have dedicated special supplementary poems. When I hear the sound of the drums, then I think [I am reminded] of the generals and soldiers, who are our state. These paintings inspired the same feeling in me. Before the completion of these paintings, I constantly imagined myself touring the battleground even during my busy dealings of government affairs at court. Now with these paintings that show everything vividly before my eyes, I feel as if I am commanding the soldiers on the battlefield…  Sorrowfully inscribed by the Qianlong emperor in the spring of February-March, 1766   transcribed by Wei Bingqing, translated by Lisa Claypool  Read More +",Inscription

The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a leopard rendered in tapestry weave with details painted with ink, representing a third rank military official. The leopard is identified by its spots, which look like geometric marks throughout its body, and green eyebrows, which are typical in the late Qing dynasty. The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The leopard is positioned in the center of the badge, surrounded by clouds, small white flowers, bats, and other auspicious symbols. Select details are highlighted with metal-wrapped threads, including the standing water waves below the leopard. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official. The border features show characters and bats, which are symbols of luck.",Description

2005.5.108,描述,"This Tibetan robe incorporates segments of Chinese rank badges, which have been stitched into a patchwork fabric. Typically, a rank badge features a single animal symbolizing the wearer's rank. However, on the left sleeve, there is a lion representing a second rank military officer, while the right sleeve displays a leopard symbolizing the third military rank. At the center, where the blue dragon is intersected, two qilin badges—indicating the first military rank—are repeated, alongside a panther badge representing the sixth military rank. On the back, the central section includes two crane badges, signifying the first rank for civil officials and a panther badge. These additional segments extend both the body and sleeve lengths, suggesting that the original dragon-patterned fabric was not sized for the Tibetan owner.",Description

2005.5.547,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a goose, which represents the fourth rank of a civil official. The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with counted stitch embroidery made from polychrome silk floss and metal-wrapped threads. In the center of the badge is a goose standing on rocks and surrounded by waves. The bird is looking toward a red sun at the upper left corner. Blue curvilinear clouds fill the background of the top of the badge, while interlinked ruyi clouds form a line underneath the waves. The bottom shows diagonal stripes, representing standing water, woven in two-toned metal-wrapped threads. The Eight Buddhist Treasures are scattered throughout, including the parasol, canopy, endless knot and lotus in the sky, and the vase, fish, conch, and wheel in the waves. The border of the badge features black embroidery with bats (which represent fortune) and longevity characters.",Description

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This badge is considered incomplete, as there is no bird or beast in the design. Surrounding the central blank space are clouds set against a dark background, with a scholar’s rock and wave-like pattern at the bottom.",Description

From a bird’s-eye perspective the viewer is given a sense of height and distance in order to reveal the entire scene at once. In the midground of the painting, Lu uses smooth washes of ink to indicate abstract mountainous forms. The varying shades of cyan, gray, and black make the layers of the painting rich and vibrant. The travellers, which are painted using colourful brush strokes outlined in thick black ink, are highly detailed in relation to their environment.

2004.19.7,描述,"This hanging scroll by Zhang Hong (b. 1954) depicts a pink mountain range with waterfalls emerging above the clouds, which have been created using negative space. The overall composition reveals artist Zhang Hong’s diligent study of Chinese “orthodox” landscape painting skills. Orthodox painting focuses on the natural world and the depiction of landscapes as idealized and harmonious spaces, with an emphasis on brushwork, composition and the use of ink wash. Zhang incorporates orthodox school techniques in his painting through the use of brushstrokes to create a sense of movement and dynamism, as well as the delicate balance of gradient tones to depict natural elements. His emphasis on negative space in the depiction of clouds and waterfalls is a technique often used in the orthodox school, and helps to create a sense of depth and space within the painting.",Description

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  This rank badge displays a mandarin duck, representing a seventh rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. Early Qing badges used gold-wrapped thread embroidered in dense rows, carefully outlining each motif until the background was completely filled. The bird is perched on a scholar's rock, which is a particularly-shaped rock appreciated by the literati and found in Chinese gardens. The rock is stitched with peacock-feather twisted thread.",Description

He carries a bundle on his back, wrapped in cloth and securely tied. The load is so heavy that he is bent over. His attire is simple and loose-fitting, suggesting that he is a laborer from a lower class.

It contains 67 leaves consisting of 36 finely detailed colour paintings, 27 pages of descriptive text written on silk, and two double-width leaves bearing official court seals. According to the seals, the album was once in the Yuanming Yuan collection owned by the Qianlong Emperor (1711-1799). These album leaves are part of a section of the illustrations of costumes from the Qianlong court, Huangchao liqi tushi (“The Regulations for the Ceremonial Paraphernalia of the [Qing] Dynasty”). Qianlong Emperor commissioned Prince Yunlu (1695-1767) to lead the editorial team, including scholar-officials and painters, in compiling the final regulations, which were published in 1759. Aside from costumes, Huangchao liqi tushi also includes descriptive texts and colourful illustrations of the instruments and devices used in imperial rituals.",Description

The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a crane, which is identified by its red crown and white feathers. The crane is standing on a rock amidst multi-coloured waves, pink peonies, trees, and clouds. The motifs on these badges, which are identical for the front and back, have been rendered in tapestry weave with a brilliant gold background. The sun on the left side of these badges indicates that the wearer was male.",Description

Each sleeve band has a mirrored scene of five children - all boys - playing in a garden amongst peonies, peaches, trees, and rocks. The children are dressed in garments that were popular for youth in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). A boy near the top of the band holds a conch shell, which is an auspicious Buddhist symbol. Although the bands are woven in kesi, details have been added with painted ink, including colour gradients in the flowers and children's clothing. Sleeve bands are the wide decorated cuffs attached to women's robes and jackets, often made and sold separately from the rest of the garment. They became important commercial objects in the Qing Dynasty as they are modular accessories that could be purchased in a market and attached to the garment at home.",Description

The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  This pair of rank badges features a bear, representing a fifth rank military official. The bear insignia is distinguishable from the higher-ranking lion by the absence of a mane along its back, though the two designs share a similarity in overall appearance. This particular badge  is crafted entirely with knot stitches and couched cord. The border is adorned with stylized running dragons, bats, and shou characters (symbolizing longevity)",Description

The pheasant on the right is male, while the left one is female. This typical composition speaks to marriage and romantic relationships. The  pink and purple peonies that surround the birds represent wealth, honour, and good fortune. In the upper portion of the table frontal there are peaches, a crane and the roof of a building. The background and borders are woven with scintillating gold-wrapped thread, which adds luxury to this textile. The border also includes a phoenix and lotus flower motif.",Description

2005.5.553.2,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a silver pheasant representing the fifth rank of a civil official. This bird is identified by its white feathers, white crown with a red stripe and long tail. The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. This rank badge pair was decorated with smooth satin stitches surrounded by couched metal-wrapped threads. Bats (which represent fortune) and auspicious motifs are scattered among coin-shaped clouds. The background is filled with green geometric lines and  wan symbols (similar in form, but not ideology, to a swastika), which symbolize infinity. In the centre of the badge is a silver pheasant standing on rocks above the waves and water, looking toward a red sun in the upper right corner. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the badge was used by the spouse of a civil official and decorated with her husband’s rank.",Description

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a bear embroidered in gold metal-wrapped and multicoloured silk floss, which represents a fifth rank military official. Bears and lions are often confused on rank badges, as the bear has a mane and tail that appears similar to a lion's. However, a bear's tail curls only at the base, whereas a lion's tail curls at the base and tip. A lion also has a curly mane, while a bear's mane hangs in straight tendrils.  The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The sun on the right side of these badges indicates that the wearer was female, likely the spouse of a military official. The bear, positioned at the center of the badge, is surrounded by flames, clouds, rocks, and standing water waves. A flaming wheel, a Buddhist symbol, can be seen amongst the waves with other obscured treasures. There are bats throughout the sky, which are a symbol of good luck. Many flowers are embroidered in the background, including peonies. Gold metal-wrapped threads outline auspicious symbols and also make up the geometric border design.",Description

Surrounding the praying mantis are multicoloured floral motifs and flowering gourds, hu lu, which have a homophonous pronunciation of “happiness” and “wealth” in Mandarin. This type of purse is a da lian, or money purse, and it would have been attached to a belt worn around a man's waist. As mens garments did not have pockets, they kept all of their everyday essentials, including fan cases, spectacle cases, tobacco pouch, watch purse, brush holder, and a case for visiting cards on these belts. The praying mantis, tang lang, relates to a house full of treasures and represents wealth or fortune.",Description

2004.19.10,描述,"Using a combination of rough, thick brush sketches and coloured ink, the painting Fishing Village by Wu Guanzhong (1919-2010) depicts the seaside view of Shitang - located in the eastern part of Zhejiang province. The foreground is dominated by geometrically-shaped residential houses, which accurately capture the characteristics of white-walled and black-tiled Jiangnan style residential buildings. The background, mainly delineated by curvilinear lines, presents the ebb and flow of the sea. In the upper right corner of the painting, Wu Guanzhong wrote, “Ten days in the fishing village reminiscing about Shitang, busy with work all day and night, the islanders have no time to enjoy the sea waves.” This suggests the overall nostalgic tone of the painting – the artist’s longing for Shitang.",Description

2004.19.38,描述,"This album consists of 12 paintings depicting different scenes of people and animals, accompanied by inscriptions written in regulated verse, featuring four lines of seven characters each (七言绝句).  The paintings were done by Ren Yi, also known as Ren Bonian (1840-1895). He was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. In 1868, he relocated to Shanghai. This move brought him into a more urban environment that was influenced by Western ideas. In Shanghai, he became part of the Shanghai School, which merged popular and traditional artistic styles. Ren Bonian was recognized alongside Ren Xiong, Ren Xun, and Ren Yu as one of the ""Four Rens.""  The calligraphic poems were crafted by Liu Taixi (1899-1989), a calligrapher commissioned by Zhou Maifu (1929-2011). Based on the inscription on 2004.19.38.20, written by the calligrapher Taixi at the age of 86, the estimated date for the calligraphy is around 1985, nearly 90 years after Ren Yi's death. The time difference indicates that the inscriptions were added to the paintings at a much later date (ca.1985). The golden-yellow cover is made of damask, featuring swirling cloud motifs and circular medallions containing dragons. This album opens vertically. Once flipped open, the top portion features an inscription, while the bottom half displays a painting framed by a damask border with wavy patterns. Both the inscription and the painting are mounted on a large sheet of yellow paper, with the yellow edges visible around the borders.",Description

2016.3.1,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  These rank badges feature an egret, representing a sixth rank civil official. It is couched in silver thread, with its head highlighted in gold. Perched on one leg atop the stone, it gazes at the sun disc in the top right corner. Surrounding the bird are clouds, Daoist emblems, and gold scrolling vines. Additional auspicious symbols, including Buddhist emblems, are interspersed among ruyi-shaped waves along the li shui border at the bottom. The badge is embroidered using fine counted-stitch embroidery on black silk gauze.",Description

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  This rank badge features a tiger, symbolizing a fourth rank military official. The tiger is crouching on a rock and surrounded by ruyi-shaped clouds. The pattern on the badge is embroidered with fine seed stitches. The border is adorned with bats and shou characters (symbolizing longevity).",Description

The ink and watercolour scene on this leaf shows a man (the “thief”) being punished with a large stick, possibly made of bamboo, by three officials. Two of the officials hold the man on the ground, where he is being struck on his buttocks by a third official. The officials wear hats with red tassels and small finials, which are a typical part of officials’ costumes in the Qing dynasty. The man being punished has the top and sides of his head completely shaved with a long braid down the back (a “queue”), which was a regulated Manchu hairstyle during the Qing dynasty.",Description

2005.5.105,描述,"This robe is a traditional style of Tibetan robe, or a chuba, made from yellowish-orange damask with vivid brocade, on the top and the bands on cuffs and skirt, woven together into one fabric, which was imported from China. In Tibet  it was constructed in the local style: right side opening with overlapping front, long narrow sleeves, and a full length hem. The pattern design was influenced by a Ming-era court robe cloth from the 17th century, or possibly even earlier. Two large dragons wind across the shoulders in a petal shape and a band along the hem and cuffs features more dragons. The yellowish-orange ground fabric is satin damask with cloud motifs. Underneath the overlap there are patches cut from different fabrics and pieced together. The lining is a green cotton cloth printed with dragon and auspicious motifs. This printed cotton can be traced to the early 20th century. The robe demonstrates how Tibetans used vintage Chinese silk and new cotton fabric to create their unique style of garment.",Description

It contains more than one hundred fragments pieced together on the front, back and the front left flap. That implies Tibetans highly valued Chinese silks and reused them to avoid waste. At the center front of the robe there is a tapestry fragment depicting a phoenix standing on a rock in a peony garden. Below, two large tapestry fragments with descending blue dragons are pieced together near the hem. A large green and red dragon, portrayed in tapestry weave with gold metal-wrapped threads, is on the centre back. Under this dragon are two blue dragons leaping above waves, rocks and water. Interestingly, the dragons on the front and back of the robe have hooves instead of claws. More patterns are on the top of the robe, such as cranes, frogs, lotus diamond-shapes, and other auspicious ornaments. They include secular and religious longing representing longevity, wealth, fortune, and purity.",Description

The Qin bridge is the legendary place where Qin Shi Huang, founder of the Qin Dynasty and Emperor, fed his horses on his eastern tour. The upper part of the scroll is mainly composed of rocky mountain cliffs, with the Qin bridge and a house below. Lai Shaoqi (1915 -2000) employs different-sized colour blocks to represent the unusual rocks and utilizes comparatively fine brush strokes to sketch the house under the mountain. He uses diluted ink, ochre, and stone blue (shi qing, 石青) in layers to create a heavy, yet tranquil painting. Contrast between the white of the modest house at the bottom of the hill and the slightly muted hues of the rocks on the cliff adds interest to the composition.",Description

2005.5.587,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  These rank badges feature a flycatcher, representing a ninth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. The bird perches on rocks, surrounded with bamboo and cherry blossoms. The badge is adorned with counted stitch embroidery on silk gauze.",Description

The painting is composed of light washes of blue and pink, which create a multi-layered colour gradation within the scenery. The lower parts of the mountain are obscured by low-lying clouds, leaving only the peaks visible. These clouds, created with negative space, surround landscape shapes that simultaneously emerge from and disappear into the thick, moist atmosphere.",Description

2004.19.15.1,描述,"Emperor Qianlong (r.1735-1799) commissioned court artist Xu Yang to document his 1751 southern inspection tour with a pictorial record, painted onto 12 handscrolls and completed in 1770. This painting is the second scroll of 12 and it depicts the royal procession traveling along the Grand Canal after leaving Beijing, about to enter the city of Dezhou in Shandong province. The handscroll is quite large, measuring 68.5 x 1686.5 cm, and is viewed from right to left. The painting begins with a poetry inscription by Yu Mingzhong (1714-1779) and has two small seals after his signature. Seven of Emperor Qianlong's seals are impressed on the scroll at the beginning of the painting, including three big square red seals.  On the right side of the scroll, the painting features the emperor's escorts and procession. They are crossing the Grand Canal on a floating bridge, surrounded by crowds of local officials and other inhabitants kneeling on either shore, welcoming the Emperor’s procession. Further along in Dezhou, we see officials and other residents anticipating the Emperor’s arrival, as well as architecture and daily life activities in the 18th century. After Dezhou, moving left along the scroll, we see the suburbs outside of the town. Several mounted officers, some of them pulling carts, seem to be part of an advanced imperial entourage going ahead to scout the path for Qianlong Emperor’s smooth journey (Tsang, Ka bo, 2008). At the left end of the picture impressed a small rectangular red seal by the collector Jin Cheng (1879-1926). The seal inscribes six characters as “Jin Gong Bo jing jian yin.” The handscroll has an original carved jade clasp inscribed with the names of Emperor Qianlong, the artist Xu Yang, and the title of the handscroll.",Description

Though the lines and colours are simplistic, the painting is carefully composed. Wang emphasizes structure and faithfully depicts the contours of the figure. While he uses only a few strokes to outline, the expressions accurately convey the subject’s inner life and character. For instance, we can tell from his attire that Qi Baishi was a very traditional man, and we seem to feel his insightful gaze penetrating through his lenses. Wang’s use of lines is quite distinctive, and has a certain degree of calligraphic charm.",Description

Ruyi, an auspicious wish-granting symbol, sit atop either side vent and are further accentuated by the aforementioned commercial ribbons. The robe is lined with a light yellow plain weave silk.

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  This pair of rank badges feature a peacock, representing a third rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. The eight Buddhist treasures are scattered throughout the design, including a parasol, endless knot, lotus blossom, victory banner, wheel, vase, carp, and conch shell. This badge is woven in tapestry, with a ground made from gold metal-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss. Ink is used for details and outlines.",Description

2005.5.390,描述,"Blue silk crepe fragment embroidered with two qilin, which resemble dragons but have hooves instead of claws. This fragment is from a robe, and the two qilin have wrapped around the wearer's collar. The qilin have been rendered in gold metal-wrapped threads, which have been couched into place to add texture to their bodies. They are surrounded by peonies, other flowers, and auspicious symbols. Even though use of the dragon motif was restricted through the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties, civilians and lower-ranking courtiers still coveted dragon designs. In order to avoid violating regulations set out by the imperial courts, variations of the dragon motif were applied to textiles, garments, and other material culture.",Description

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This rank badge depicts a xiezhi, a mythical creature composed of a deer-like body with one horn on its head. Renowned for its ability to discern right from wrong, the xiezhi serves as a symbol of justice that triumphs over evil. In the imperial court, it represented the role of the imperial censor, tasked with overseeing the ethical behaviour of officials.",Description

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  This pair of rank badges features a panther, symbolizing a sixth rank military official.

2004.19.38.23,描述,"The painting is associated with the poem (2004.19.38.22). An elderly figure stands next to a large, white horse. The person appears to be guiding or holding the horse by a leash. He only shows his back, with his head slightly turned to the left, as if glancing back to check on the horse. The horse is slightly bent forward, grazing or simply standing peacefully. The background is made up of soft, misty brushstrokes, depicting a serene landscape with muted colors.   The inscription on the right states, “Written by Ren Yi, also known as Ren Bonian, from Shanyin, over the Huangpu River [畯師冬心居士(金農)法書山陰任頤伯年寫於浦上].”",Description

2005.5.247.2,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. This Ming-era rank badge features a pair of peacocks, representing a third-rank civil official. Surrounding the birds in this badge are peonies and clouds. This badge is woven in tapestry, with a ground made from gold-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss. """,Description

2005.5.128,描述,"This square dark-brown canopy consists of two panels sewn together, which were initially made for a robe cloth. A brilliant four petal-shaped brocade decorates the centre of the canopy, containing two active dragons. These dragons, woven in gold-wrapped threads and polychrome silk floss, have four claws (mang) and are surrounded by vivid red flames. There are colourful clouds scattered around the dragons, with four sets of clouds forming a ring in the centre, where they would have initially surrounded the neckline of a robe. Woven waves and rocks provide a border around the petal shape.  At close inspection, the dark brown background is a satin damask with a continuous cloud pattern. Both the background damask and dragon brocade were woven in one piece. This canopy, although following a typical Ming era court robe style, would have been used to decorate the top of a temple.",Description

However, in 1916, Yuan Shikai attempted to restore the Qing Empire by declaring himself Emperor Hongxian. This embroidered roundel, featuring the Twelve Symbols of Imperial Authority, serves as an example of his effort to invoke imperial imagery. There are nine motifs of the Twelve Symbols embroidered on the roundel, including a pair of cups, seaweed, fire, grain, an axe, a pheasant, a dragon, mountains and the fu character in the centre. Encircling the entire composition is a border of circular ruyi-shaped clouds.",Description

This sleeve band mirrors the scene of its partner, which depicts five children - all boys - playing in a garden amongst peonies, peaches, trees, and rocks. The children are dressed in garments that were popular for youth in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). A boy near the top of the band holds a conch shell, which is an auspicious Buddhist symbol. Although this band is woven in kesi, details have been added with painted ink, including colour gradients in the flowers and children's clothing. Sleeve bands are the wide decorated cuffs attached to women's robes and jackets, often made and sold separately from the rest of the garment. They became important commercial objects in the Qing Dynasty as they are modular accessories that could be purchased in a market and attached to the garment at home.",Description

2005.5.588,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  This pair of rank badges features a flycatcher, representing a ninth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird was seen on rank badges. The flycatcher is surrounded by ruyi-shaped clouds and four bats, with its wings spread wide and gaze directed toward the sun disk in the upper left corner. This badge is embroidered with gold-metal wrapped thread and silk floss using counted stitches on silk gauze.",Description

2010.17.89,描述,"This photolithographic political poster from the late 20th century suggests that Chinese youth should study Lei Feng (1940-1962), a model soldier, to create a new generation.  The focal point of this poster is a portrait of Lei Feng, surrounded by elementary school children engaged in a variety of activities, including young pioneers being guided by their teacher to take an oath under the red flag, assisting the elderly in crossing the street, learning how to use a computer, and playing soccer and ping pong. Red dominates the image, including the title, which has a powerful visual impact. This poster conveys the spirit of the communist regime in China and has a strong propaganda effect. It seems to raise people’s awareness of following the path of Lei Feng, that is to study hard, live well, and contribute to the modernization of the country.",Description

2010.17.87,描述,"This folk art painting depicts three women washing indigo dye from long strips of cloth in a river. It is a reproduction of a work made by artist Luo Zhijian (b. 1954) of Hu County, Shaanxi, using a painting technique reminiscent of collage. He uses bold and bright colours, with clever use of contrast, to draw the viewer’s attention to the figures at the top of the painting. The women's posture and facial expressions are also expertly captured, conveying a sense of shared purpose and companionship as they work together to complete the task at hand. The details of their clothing, hairstyles, and accessories provide a glimpse into the daily life of rural Chinese women in this time period.",Description

This leaf has an ink and watercolour drawing of two men punishing a third (the “thief”), with one man holding the man’s head by his head and neck, while the other prepares to strike him with a club. There is an official’s hat on the lower left of the scene, likely belonging to the man wielding the club. The kneeling figure is wearing pants with a mid-length top, while the two standing figures are wearing official’s robes. The two figures without hats have the top and sides of their heads completely shaved with a long braid down the back (a “queue”), which was a regulated Manchu hairstyle during the Qing dynasty.",Description

2004.19.92,描述,"A large painting on silk depicting the Muslim Rebellion in Shaanxi, Gansu and Xinjiang provinces, which are represented homogeneously as a landscape with cliffs, mountains, a river and trees. A strategic perspective from atop a mountain oversees all of the action, including various army camps and infantry. Some mounted soldiers appear in active pursuit of their enemy, while other regiments march in formation. Notable figures have small name plates positioned above their heads to identify them to the viewer. This painting is part of a larger series of approximately 70 paintings commissioned by the Guangxu Emperor in 1885, approved by Empress Dowager Cixi in 1886, and completed in 1890. These paintings - split into four groups - commemorate the Taiping War, the Nian Rebellion, the Muslim Rebellion in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, and the Muslim Rebellion on the southwest and northwest borders. The military prowess of the Qing government is highlighted and glorified in each of these paintings. Two of these paintings are accessioned in the Mactaggart Art Collection, please see Battle Scene from the Muslim Rebellions in Shaanxi, Gansu and Xinjiang Provinces (2004.19.92)",Description

2005.5.588.1,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  This rank badge features a flycatcher, representing a ninth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird was seen on rank badges. The flycatcher is surrounded by ruyi-shaped clouds and four bats, with its wings spread wide and gaze directed toward the sun disk in the upper left corner. This badge is embroidered with gold-metal wrapped thread and silk floss using counted stitches on silk gauze.",Description

The two cottages, which are on stilts, are surrounded by the river, the mountains and a few pine trees. The foliage in the foreground is much darker and sharper than the landscape in the distance, which creates distance and also a misty dream-like atmosphere. The mountains in the far distance are painted with a wash of light blue paint, which adds to the peaceful scene.",Description

2005.5.590.1,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This badge is considered incomplete, as there is no bird or beast in the design. Surrounding the central blank space are clouds set against a dark background, with a scholar’s rock and wave-like pattern at the bottom.",Description

The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  This rank badge features a flycatcher, representing a ninth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird was seen on rank badges. The flycatcher is surrounded by ruyi-shaped clouds and four bats, with its wings spread wide and gaze directed toward the sun disk in the upper left corner. This badge is embroidered with gold-metal wrapped thread and silk floss using counted stitches on silk gauze.",Description

2005.5.556.2,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  This rank badge features a quail, representing an eighth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. This bird is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. This badge is woven in tapestry, with gold metal-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss. Coloured ink was used for colour gradation.",Description

2016.3.1.2,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts.  This rank badge features an egret, representing a sixth rank civil official. It is couched in silver thread, with its head highlighted in gold. Perched on one leg atop the stone, it gazes at the sun disc in the top right corner. Surrounding the bird are clouds, Daoist emblems, and gold scrolling vines. Additional auspicious symbols, including Buddhist emblems, are interspersed among ruyi-shaped waves along the li shui border at the bottom. The badge is embroidered using fine counted-stitch embroidery on black silk gauze.",Description

2005.5.592.1,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a leopard rendered in tapestry weave with details painted with ink, representing a third rank military official. The leopard is identified by its spots, which look like geometric marks throughout its body, and green eyebrows, which are typical in the late Qing dynasty. The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The leopard is positioned in the center of the badge, surrounded by clouds, small white flowers, bats, and other auspicious symbols. Select details are highlighted with metal-wrapped threads, including the standing water waves below the leopard. The position of the sun on the right side of the badge indicates that the wearer was a woman, likely the spouse of a military official. The border features show characters and bats, which are symbols of luck.",Description

2004.19.38.3,描述,"The painting is associated with the poem (2004.19.38.2). It portrays a man seated on rocks within a mountainous landscape. Dressed in a traditional robe with a blue head covering, the figure is shown in a calm, relaxed position, with his arms resting on the rocks. The background is rendered with soft, fluid brushstrokes, evoking the misty atmosphere of the distant hills. The crane, standing on one leg, contrasts with the man’s stillness.

2004.19.72.4,描述,"This is the fourth leaf from the Figures in River Landscape album by Wang Gai (1677-1705), which is painted with ink and colour on paper. Each leaf contains a landscape, which was painted in situ by Wang Gai. Repeating themes throughout the album include figures immersed in the natural environment, which reflects the literati’s yearning and nostalgia. In this scene, a fisherman sits on a boat watching a flock of birds fly towards the horizon. He appears relaxed, with a fishing line hanging off the side of the boat. The three clusters of river bamboo on the side of the boat are painted with different tones of black ink to indicate depth. The fading of the distant bamboo into the background is a technique found throughout this album.",Description

Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This rank badge features a silver pheasant, representing a fifth rank civil official. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top right corner. The pattern on the badge is embroidered with fine seed stitches of multicoloured silk floss. The metallic  background is made from couched gold metal-wrapped thread.",Description

The towering cliffs contrast to the small scale of the figures, emphasizing the vastness of nature.  The inscription on the right states, “Written by Ren Yi, also known as Ren Bonian from Shanyin, in his residence at the sea [山陰伯年任頤寫於海上庽齋東牕下并记]”, and the red seal belongs to Ren Yi.",Description

The figure on the right sits in a structure with their head in a square wooden collar, sometimes referred to as a cangue, which acts as a portable pillory.

Under the written inscription is a square seal that states “precious collection of the Celestial Palace” (tien-fu-Jen-cang).  The lid is decorated with gilt dragons and clouds against the black lacquer background. There are nine dragons on the lid: three vertical dragons moving among clouds on the top, two horizontal dragons on each long side and one front-facing coiled dragon on each short side.

2005.5.557.2,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. This pair of rank badges features a bear embroidered in gold metal-wrapped and multicoloured silk floss, which represents a fifth rank military official. Bears and lions are often confused on rank badges, as the bear has a mane and tail that appears similar to a lion's. However, a bear's tail curls only at the base, whereas a lion's tail curls at the base and tip. A lion also has a curly mane, while a bear's mane hangs in straight tendrils.  The front badge is made into two separate panels to accommodate the front opening of a surcoat, while the back badge is made in one piece. The patterns on the front and back badges are identical. The sun on the right side of these badges indicates that the wearer was female, likely the spouse of a military official. The bear, positioned at the center of the badge, is surrounded by flames, clouds, rocks, and standing water waves. A flaming wheel, a Buddhist symbol, can be seen amongst the waves with other obscured treasures. There are bats throughout the sky, which are a symbol of good luck. Many flowers are embroidered in the background, including peonies. Gold metal-wrapped threads outline auspicious symbols and also make up the geometric border design.",Description

The figure, shown from behind, is cloaked in a red robe and carries a walking staff. A large tree trunk stretching from the left side has wide-reaching branches covered in delicate white blossoms, painted with gentle, dappled brushstrokes. The white specks could represent either falling snow or plum blossoms. In either case, they are dense enough to weigh down the branches, causing them to bend and touch the ground. The inscription in the bottom left corner reads, “Ren Yi, also known as Ren Bonian from Shanyin [山陰仁颐伯年],” and the red seal belongs to Ren Yi.",Description

2005.5.545,描述,"Rank badges, always made in pairs, were placed on the front and back of surcoats in order to communicate their wearer’s rank during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Different motifs were regulated by the imperial court, including bird motifs used only for civil officials, while beasts were used for military officials. The hierarchy of ranks within these categories was represented by specific birds and beasts. In the Ming Dynasty, the birds on rank badges were often presented in pairs in an upper and lower position. Later, in the Qing Dynasty, only one bird or beast was seen on rank badges.  This pair of rank badges features a golden pheasant, representing a second-rank civil official. It is perched on a rock and gazing at a sun disc in the top left corner. Surrounding the birds in this badge are clouds and waves. These badges are made with gold and silver metal-wrapped thread and details rendered in multi-coloured silk floss.",Description

2004.19.75.1,描述,"Emperor Kangxi (r.1661-1722), the third monarch of the Qing Dynasty, made six tours to southern China from 1684 to 1707. He commissioned imperial artist Wang Hui (1632-1717) to document the second tour in 12 handscrolls. This painting is the seventh scroll of the series, which depicts the route from Wuxi to Suzhou during the Emperor’s second tour in 1689. The front fringe of the mounted scroll has one label with three parts: “the picture of the southern inspection tour” (nan-xun-tu), “the seventh scroll “ (di-qi juan), and “the route from Wuxi county to the emperor’s accommodation at Suzhou’s official residence” (zi-wuxi-xian zhubi suzhou-fu). At the beginning of the handscroll, which is viewed from right to left, a poetry inscription, titled “Reverence picture of the seventh scroll”, describes people welcoming the Emperor’s procession along the route. The poetry also honours Emperor Kangxi for his mercy and granting tax waivers to the Suzhou people. The scroll bears no red seals. Following the inscription, the painting begins with the countryside scenery of Qingyuan, Huishan temple, and Xishan. Further along, we see Wuxi county with boats on the river and busy streets along the canal. Afterwards, the scenery shows Xin-an, Hu-shu-guan (a bustling city with cargo ships and tax collecting near the Grand Canal), Shan-tang, and Hu-Qiu. In all of these places there is flourishing urban life, both on the streets and the river. Following these cities, we see Chanmen (the Chan gate) of Suzhou and the Emperor’s procession in ships surrounded by a welcoming parade on the dock. The scene moves into the city of Suzhou, showing the busy streets with decorations and the gathering crowds anticipating the Emperor’s arrival. Further to the left, near the end of the painting, we see the Suzhou Weaving Office, which is preparing for the Emperor’s arrival.",Description
